# Technical Specifications

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Justice Bid Rate Negotiation System is a comprehensive platform designed to systematize the legal rate negotiation process between law firms and their clients. The system addresses the inefficient, email-based negotiation process currently used in the industry by providing a structured, analytics-driven approach to rate proposals, negotiations, and approvals.

The platform serves two primary user groups - law firms seeking to propose new rates to their clients, and corporate legal departments (clients) who need to evaluate, negotiate, and approve these rates. By incorporating AI-driven analytics, third-party performance data, and automated workflows, the system delivers actionable recommendations while maintaining a complete audit trail of all negotiations.

The expected business impact includes significant time savings, improved decision-making through data-driven insights, and better outcomes for both law firms and clients through transparent, structured negotiations.

### SYSTEM OVERVIEW

#### Project Context

| Aspect | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Business Context | The legal industry lacks a systematic approach to rate negotiations, relying on email exchanges and manual analytics. Justice Bid aims to fill this gap with a purpose-built platform. |
| Current Limitations | Existing eBilling systems can only accept or reject rates without supporting negotiation workflows. Analytics are performed outside these systems, and there's no structured way to track negotiation history. |
| Enterprise Integration | The system will integrate with clients' eBilling systems (Onit, TeamConnect, Legal Tracker, BrightFlag) and law firms' billing systems to exchange historical data and approved rates. |

#### High-Level Description

The Justice Bid Rate Negotiation System is an AI-first platform that facilitates the entire rate negotiation lifecycle between law firms and their clients. The system provides:

- Structured workflows for rate requests, submissions, negotiations, and approvals
- Comprehensive analytics comparing proposed rates against historical data and peer groups
- Integration with third-party performance data (UniCourt) for attorney evaluation
- AI-driven recommendations for rate proposals and negotiations
- Configurable approval workflows within both client and law firm organizations
- Secure messaging and notification systems for all communications
- Outside Counsel Guidelines management with negotiable sections
- Flexible data import/export capabilities via API and file uploads

The architecture employs a React.js frontend with a robust backend data structure supporting various data formats, multiple currencies, and complex organizational hierarchies.

#### Success Criteria

| Criteria | Measurement |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Adoption Rate | Number of law firms and clients actively using the platform |
| Negotiation Efficiency | Average time from rate request to approval compared to baseline |
| Data-Driven Decisions | Percentage of rate decisions supported by system analytics |
| Integration Success | Number of successful integrations with eBilling and law firm systems |
| User Satisfaction | Satisfaction scores from both law firm and client users |

## 5. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### HIGH-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE

#### System Overview

The Justice Bid Rate Negotiation System employs a modern microservices architecture with a React.js frontend and a Python-based backend. This architecture was selected to provide the flexibility needed for the complex rate negotiation workflows while ensuring scalability as the system grows.

The system follows several key architectural principles:

- **API-First Design**: All functionality is exposed through well-defined APIs, enabling seamless integration with external systems like eBilling platforms and UniCourt.
- **Domain-Driven Design**: The system is organized around business domains (rate management, negotiations, analytics, etc.) rather than technical layers.
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Key business events (rate submissions, approvals, etc.) trigger notifications and workflow transitions.
- **Polyglot Persistence**: Different data storage technologies are used based on the nature of the data (relational for structured rate data, document-based for messages and OCGs).
- **AI-First Approach**: AI capabilities are integrated throughout the system with configurable AI environments to support client preferences.

System boundaries are clearly defined with dedicated integration services managing connections to external systems like eBilling platforms, law firm billing systems, and UniCourt. The system exposes RESTful APIs for data exchange and webhook endpoints for event notifications.

#### Core Components Table

| Component | Primary Responsibility | Key Dependencies | Critical Considerations |
| --------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| Rate Management Service | Handles rate data lifecycle including submissions, approvals, and history | Organization Service, Analytics Service | Must maintain complete audit trail of all rate changes |
| Negotiation Service | Manages the negotiation workflow between law firms and clients | Rate Management Service, Messaging Service | Must support complex approval workflows and real-time updates |
| Analytics Engine | Processes historical and current rate data to provide insights and recommendations | Rate Management Service, Data Import Service | Must handle large volumes of historical data efficiently |
| AI Service | Provides AI-powered recommendations, chat functionality, and process management | All services (consumes data from across the system) | Must support both Justice Bid and client AI environments |
| Organization Service | Manages organization hierarchies, users, and permissions | Authentication Service | Must support complex organizational structures and relationships |
| Integration Hub | Coordinates data exchange with external systems | All services (provides data to/from external systems) | Must handle various integration patterns and data formats |
| Messaging Service | Manages secure communications between parties | Notification Service, Organization Service | Must maintain hierarchical message structure with complete history |

#### Data Flow Description

The primary data flow begins with the import of historical rate and billing data from client eBilling systems or law firm billing systems through the Integration Hub. This data is processed, transformed, and stored in the system's databases to establish the baseline for rate negotiations.

When a rate negotiation begins, the Negotiation Service orchestrates the workflow, starting with a rate request from either a law firm or client. The Rate Management Service handles the submission of proposed rates, which are then analyzed by the Analytics Engine to provide insights on the impact and competitiveness of the rates.

During negotiation, the Messaging Service facilitates secure communications between parties, with all messages and rate proposals flowing through the Negotiation Service to maintain a complete audit trail. The AI Service provides recommendations at key decision points, analyzing the proposed rates against historical data, peer comparisons, and performance metrics.

As rates are approved, the Rate Management Service updates the rate status and notifies relevant parties through the Notification Service. Finally, approved rates can be exported back to client eBilling systems or law firm billing systems through the Integration Hub.

Throughout this process, the Organization Service enforces access controls based on user roles and permissions, ensuring that users only see data they are authorized to access.

#### External Integration Points

| System Name | Integration Type | Data Exchange Pattern | Protocol/Format | SLA Requirements |
| ----------- | ---------------- | --------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |

| Law Firm Billing Systems | Bidirectional | Import of attorney profiles and standard rates, export of approved rates | REST API, File Import/Export | 99% availability during business hours, <3s response time |
| UniCourt | Unidirectional (inbound) | Periodic import of attorney performance data | REST API | 98% availability, <5s response time |
| OpenAI/Client AI Environment | Bidirectional | Real-time queries for AI recommendations and chat | REST API | 99.9% availability, <1s response time |
| SSO Providers | Unidirectional (outbound) | Authentication requests | SAML, OAuth 2.0 | 99.99% availability, <500ms response time |

### TECHNICAL DECISIONS

#### Architecture Style Decisions

| Decision | Options Considered | Selected Approach | Rationale |
| -------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | --------- |
| Overall Architecture | Monolithic, Microservices, Serverless | Microservices | Enables independent scaling of components, supports complex domain model, allows for technology diversity |
| Frontend Framework | Angular, React, Vue | React.js | Required by specifications, excellent component model for complex UIs |
| Backend Language | Java, Python, Node.js | Python | Strong support for data processing and AI integration, excellent libraries for analytics |
| API Design | REST, GraphQL, gRPC | REST with some GraphQL | REST for broad compatibility, GraphQL for complex data queries in analytics |

The microservices architecture was selected to align with the complex domain model of the rate negotiation system. Each business capability (rate management, negotiations, analytics, etc.) is implemented as a separate service with well-defined boundaries. This approach enables independent scaling of components based on demand - for example, the Analytics Engine can scale during peak reporting periods without affecting other services.

#### Communication Pattern Choices

| Pattern | Use Cases | Implementation | Considerations |
| ------- | --------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Synchronous REST | User-initiated actions, CRUD operations | HTTP/JSON with standardized error responses | Simple, widely supported, but can create tight coupling |
| Asynchronous Events | Workflow transitions, notifications | Message queue (RabbitMQ) with event schema | Loose coupling, resilience, but more complex to implement |
| WebSockets | Real-time negotiations, chat | Socket.io with fallback mechanisms | Enables real-time updates, but requires connection management |
| Batch Processing | Data imports/exports, analytics | Scheduled jobs with idempotent operations | Efficient for large data volumes, but introduces latency |

The system employs a hybrid communication approach, using synchronous REST for direct user interactions and asynchronous events for workflow transitions. This combination provides responsive user experiences while maintaining system resilience. WebSockets are used selectively for real-time features like the negotiation interface when in "Real Time" mode.

#### Data Storage Solution Rationale

| Data Type | Storage Solution | Justification |
| --------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| Rate and Billing Data | PostgreSQL | Strong consistency, complex query support, transaction support for critical financial data |
| Messages and OCGs | MongoDB | Flexible schema for varied document structures, good performance for hierarchical data |
| Search Indexes | Elasticsearch | Optimized for full-text search across messages and attorney profiles |
| Caching | Redis | High performance, support for complex data structures, pub/sub capabilities |
| File Storage | AWS S3 | Scalable, durable storage for documents, templates, and exports |

A polyglot persistence approach was selected to match storage technologies to data characteristics. PostgreSQL provides the transactional integrity needed for financial data, while MongoDB offers the flexibility required for varied document structures like messages and OCGs. This approach optimizes both performance and data integrity.

#### Error Handling Flow

```mermaid

    A[Request] --> B{Input Validation}
    B -->|Valid| C[Process Request]
    B -->|Invalid| D[Return Validation Error]
    
    C --> E{Business Rule Check}
    E -->|Pass| F[Execute Operation]
    E -->|Fail| G[Return Business Rule Error]
    
    F --> H{System Operation}
    H -->|Success| I[Return Success]
    H -->|Failure| J[Log Error]
    
    J --> K{Recoverable?}
    K -->|Yes| L[Retry Operation]
    K -->|No| M[Return System Error]
    
    L --> N{Retry Successful?}
    N -->|Yes| I
    N -->|No| O[Escalate Error]
    O --> P[Notify Admin]
    O --> M
```

### CROSS-CUTTING CONCERNS

#### Monitoring and Observability Approach

The system implements a comprehensive monitoring strategy with multiple layers:

- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: AWS CloudWatch monitors system resources (CPU, memory, disk) with automated alerts for threshold violations.
- **Application Performance Monitoring**: Datadog APM tracks service performance, latency, and error rates across all microservices.
- **Business Metrics**: Custom dashboards track key business metrics like active negotiations, approval times, and integration success rates.
- **User Experience Monitoring**: Real User Monitoring (RUM) captures frontend performance and user interactions to identify UX issues.

Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry provides end-to-end visibility across service boundaries, enabling rapid troubleshooting of complex issues. All monitoring data is centralized in Datadog for unified alerting and visualization.

#### Logging and Tracing Strategy

| Log Type | Purpose | Implementation | Retention |
| -------- | ------- | -------------- | --------- |
| Application Logs | Debugging, audit trail | Structured JSON logs with correlation IDs | 90 days |
| Security Logs | Access control, authentication | Immutable logs with tamper detection | 1 year |
| Integration Logs | API calls, data transfers | Detailed request/response logging | 30 days |
| User Activity Logs | Audit trail, compliance | Business event logging with user context | 7 years |

Logs are collected using Fluent Bit agents and centralized in Elasticsearch for searching and analysis. Critical security and audit logs are additionally archived to immutable storage for compliance purposes. All logs include correlation IDs to link related events across services.

#### Authentication and Authorization Framework

The system implements a multi-layered security approach:

- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 and SAML for SSO integration with client identity providers, with JWT tokens for session management.
- **Authorization**: RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) with fine-grained permissions at the organization, peer group, and individual entity levels.
- **API Security**: API keys with scope limitations for system integrations, rate limiting to prevent abuse.
- **Data Isolation**: Multi-tenancy with strict data partitioning to ensure organizations can only access their own data.

The Organization Service acts as the central authority for permission checks, with a permission cache to optimize performance. All permission changes are logged for audit purposes.

#### Performance Requirements and SLAs

| Component | Response Time | Throughput | Availability |
| --------- | ------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| User Interface | <1s for 95% of requests | 100 concurrent users per tenant | 99.9% during business hours |
| API Services | <500ms for 95% of requests | 1000 requests per second | 99.95% |
| Analytics Engine | <5s for standard reports | 100 concurrent report generations | 99.5% |
| AI Services | <2s for recommendations | 50 concurrent AI requests | 99.5% |
| Integration Services | <30s for data imports/exports | 10 concurrent integrations | 99.5% |

The system is designed to handle peak loads during annual rate negotiation periods, with auto-scaling capabilities to maintain performance. Database read replicas and caching strategies ensure analytics queries don't impact transactional performance.

#### Disaster Recovery Procedures

The system implements a comprehensive disaster recovery strategy:

- **Data Backup**: Automated daily backups of all databases with point-in-time recovery capabilities.
- **Multi-Region Deployment**: Critical components deployed across multiple AWS regions for high availability.
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: 4 hours for full system recovery.
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: 15 minutes maximum data loss in disaster scenarios.

Regular disaster recovery drills ensure the procedures are effective and team members are familiar with recovery processes. Documentation is maintained for all recovery procedures, including manual steps if automated recovery fails.

## 6. SYSTEM COMPONENTS DESIGN

### FRONTEND COMPONENTS

#### User Interface Architecture

The Justice Bid Rate Negotiation System frontend is built using React.js with a component-based architecture that emphasizes reusability, maintainability, and a consistent user experience. The UI architecture follows these key principles:

1. **Component Hierarchy**: Components are organized in a hierarchical structure with clear parent-child relationships
2. **Atomic Design**: UI elements follow the atomic design methodology (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages)
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Presentation components are separated from container components that manage state
4. **Responsive Design**: All components adapt to different screen sizes using responsive design principles

The high-level component structure is organized as follows:

1. **Redux**: For global application state including:
   - User authentication and permissions
   - Active negotiations and their status
   - System configuration settings
   - Notification state

2. **React Context**: For intermediate state sharing across component trees:
   - Theme and UI preferences
   - Current organization context
   - Feature flags and permissions

3. **Local Component State**: For UI-specific state:
   - Form inputs and validation
   - UI element visibility (expanded/collapsed)
   - Temporary user interactions

4. **React Query**: For server state management:
   - Data fetching and caching
   - Optimistic updates
   - Background refetching

## 6.1 CORE SERVICES ARCHITECTURE

### SERVICE COMPONENTS

The Justice Bid Rate Negotiation System employs a microservices architecture to support its complex domain model and ensure independent scalability of components. The system is divided into distinct service boundaries with clear responsibilities and communication patterns.

#### Service Boundaries and Responsibilities

| Service | Primary Responsibility | Key Dependencies | Data Domain |
| ------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| Rate Service | Manages rate data lifecycle and validation | Organization Service | Rates, Rate History |
| Negotiation Service | Orchestrates negotiation workflows | Rate Service, Messaging Service | Negotiations, Proposals |
| Analytics Service | Processes historical data for insights | Rate Service, Data Service | Analytics, Reports |
| Organization Service | Manages org hierarchies and permissions | Authentication Service | Organizations, Users |
| Messaging Service | Handles secure communications | Notification Service | Messages, Threads |
| Integration Service | Manages external system connections | Rate Service, Data Service | Integrations, Mappings |
| AI Service | Provides AI capabilities and recommendations | All services | AI Models, Recommendations |
| Document Service | Manages OCGs and document workflows | Organization Service | Documents, Templates |

#### Inter-Service Communication Patterns

The system employs multiple communication patterns based on the nature of the interaction:

| Pattern | Use Case | Implementation | Considerations |
| ------- | -------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| Synchronous REST | User-initiated actions | HTTP/JSON with standardized responses | Used for immediate user feedback |
| Asynchronous Events | Workflow state changes | RabbitMQ with event schema | Ensures loose coupling between services |
| Bulk Data Transfer | Analytics processing | Batch processing with checkpoints | Optimized for large data volumes |
| Real-time Updates | Negotiation interface | WebSockets with fallback | Enables collaborative features |

    D -- Bulk --> G
    E -- REST --> B
    E -- REST --> C
    H -- REST --> J[All Services]
    I -- Events --> F
```

#### Service Discovery and Load Balancing

| Component | Implementation | Purpose |
| --------- | -------------- | ------- |
| Service Registry | Consul | Maintains service health and location information |
| API Gateway | Kong | Routes requests and enforces policies |
| Load Balancer | AWS ALB | Distributes traffic across service instances |
| Service Mesh | Istio | Manages service-to-service communication |

The service discovery mechanism uses Consul for service registration and health checking. Each service registers with Consul upon startup and provides health check endpoints. The API Gateway (Kong) queries Consul to route requests to appropriate service instances.

Load balancing is implemented at multiple levels:
- AWS Application Load Balancer for external traffic distribution
- Istio service mesh for internal service-to-service load balancing
- Database connection pooling for database load distribution

#### Circuit Breaker and Resilience Patterns

| Pattern | Implementation | Configuration |
| ------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| Circuit Breaker | Hystrix | Threshold: 50% failure rate, Reset: 30s |
| Rate Limiting | Kong plugins | 100 req/sec per client, 1000 req/sec total |
| Bulkhead | Thread pool isolation | Separate pools for critical vs. non-critical operations |
| Timeout | Service configuration | 2s for user-facing, 30s for batch operations |

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Closed
    Closed --> Open: Failure threshold exceeded
    Open --> HalfOpen: After timeout period
    HalfOpen --> Closed: Success threshold met
    HalfOpen --> Open: Failures continue
    Open --> [*]
```

#### Retry and Fallback Mechanisms

| Operation Type | Retry Strategy | Fallback Mechanism |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| Critical User Operations | 3 retries with exponential backoff | Graceful degradation with cached data |
| Integration Operations | 5 retries with jitter | Queue for later processing |
| Batch Processing | No automatic retry | Manual intervention trigger |
| Real-time Updates | Quick retry (100ms) then fallback | Polling fallback mechanism |

### SCALABILITY DESIGN

#### Horizontal/Vertical Scaling Approach

The Justice Bid system employs a hybrid scaling approach tailored to each service's characteristics:

| Service | Scaling Approach | Scaling Trigger | Resource Allocation |
| ------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| Rate Service | Horizontal | CPU > 70%, Request count > 1000/min | 2-10 instances, 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM |
| Negotiation Service | Horizontal | Active negotiations > 100 | 2-8 instances, 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM |
| Analytics Service | Vertical + Horizontal | Queue depth > 50 | 2-4 instances, 4-8 vCPU, 8-16GB RAM |
| AI Service | Vertical | GPU utilization > 80% | 2 instances, 4 vCPU, 8GB RAM, GPU support |

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Load] --> B{API Gateway}
    B --> C[Auto Scaling Group]
    C --> D[Rate Service Instances]
    C --> E[Negotiation Service Instances]
    C --> F[Other Service Instances]
    
    G[Analytics Jobs] --> H{Queue}
    H --> I[Analytics Workers]
    I --> J[Vertical Scaling]
    I --> K[Horizontal Scaling]
    
    L[AI Requests] --> M{AI Service}
    M --> N[GPU Instances]
```

#### Auto-Scaling Triggers and Rules

| Service | Scale Out Trigger | Scale In Trigger | Cooldown Period |
| ------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Rate Service | CPU > 70% for 3 min | CPU < 40% for 10 min | 5 minutes |
| Negotiation Service | Memory > 80% for 3 min | Memory < 50% for 10 min | 5 minutes |
| Analytics Service | Queue depth > 50 for 5 min | Queue depth < 10 for 15 min | 10 minutes |
| Integration Service | Concurrent jobs > 20 | Concurrent jobs < 5 for 15 min | 5 minutes |

Auto-scaling is implemented using AWS Auto Scaling Groups with custom CloudWatch metrics for specialized triggers like queue depth and active negotiations.

#### Performance Optimization Techniques

| Technique | Implementation | Target Services |
| --------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| Caching | Redis with tiered strategy | Rate Service, Analytics Service |
| Read Replicas | PostgreSQL read replicas | All database-heavy services |
| Query Optimization | Materialized views, indexes | Analytics Service, Rate Service |
| Asynchronous Processing | Background job queues | Integration Service, Analytics Service |

The system implements a multi-level caching strategy:
- L1: In-memory cache for frequently accessed data (1-minute TTL)
- L2: Redis cache for shared data across instances (10-minute TTL)
- L3: CDN for static assets and reports (1-day TTL)

#### Capacity Planning Guidelines

| Resource | Planning Metric | Growth Factor | Monitoring |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| Database Storage | 100MB per client per year | 1.5x annual growth | Weekly projection review |
| API Capacity | 100 req/sec per 10 active users | 2x during peak periods | Real-time monitoring |
| Analytics Processing | 1 CPU core per 5 concurrent reports | 1.3x annual growth | Daily capacity review |
| AI Processing | 2 req/sec per concurrent user | 2x during negotiation periods | Hourly utilization check |

### RESILIENCE PATTERNS

#### Fault Tolerance Mechanisms

| Component | Fault Tolerance Mechanism | Recovery Time Objective |
| --------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| API Services | Multi-AZ deployment with auto-healing | < 1 minute |
| Database | Multi-AZ with automated failover | < 2 minutes |
| Message Queue | Clustered deployment with persistent storage | < 30 seconds |
| Cache | Redis cluster with sentinel | < 10 seconds |

The system employs defense-in-depth strategies for fault tolerance:
- Service-level retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
- Bulkhead patterns to isolate failures
- Graceful degradation for non-critical features

#### Disaster Recovery Procedures

| Scenario | Recovery Procedure | RTO | RPO |
| -------- | ------------------ | --- | --- |
| Single AZ Failure | Automatic failover to standby AZ | 5 minutes | 0 minutes |
| Region Failure | Manual promotion of standby region | 1 hour | 15 minutes |
| Database Corruption | Point-in-time recovery from backups | 2 hours | 5 minutes |
| Service Compromise | Isolation and redeployment from clean images | 4 hours | 0 minutes |

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Disaster Event] --> B{Impact Assessment}
    B --> C[Single AZ Failure]
    B --> D[Region Failure]
    B --> E[Data Corruption]
    
    C --> F[Automatic Failover]
    D --> G[DR Coordinator Notification]
    G --> H[Manual Region Promotion]
    E --> I[Initiate Data Recovery]
    
    F --> J[Verify Service Health]
    H --> J
    I --> J
    
    J --> K{Services Healthy?}
    K -->|Yes| L[Resume Operations]
    K -->|No| M[Escalate to Engineering]
    M --> N[Manual Intervention]
    N --> J
```

#### Data Redundancy Approach

| Data Type | Redundancy Mechanism | Consistency Model |
| --------- | -------------------- | ----------------- |
| Transactional Data | Synchronous replication to standby | Strong consistency |
| Analytical Data | Asynchronous replication with batch reconciliation | Eventual consistency |
| User Files | Multi-region S3 replication | Eventual consistency |
| Configuration | Version-controlled with GitOps | Strong consistency |

The system implements different redundancy strategies based on data criticality:
- Critical rate and negotiation data uses synchronous replication
- Analytics and historical data uses asynchronous replication
- All data is backed up daily with 30-day retention
- Point-in-time recovery capability for the previous 7 days

#### Failover Configurations

| Component | Failover Trigger | Failover Target | Verification Process |
| --------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| Database | Primary instance failure | Standby replica | Automated health check |
| API Services | Instance health check failure | New instance in ASG | API test suite |
| Cache | Primary node failure | Replica promotion | Cache validation |
| Message Queue | Broker failure | Standby broker | Message flow verification |

Failover processes are fully automated for infrastructure components and semi-automated for application services, requiring verification before completing the failover.

#### Service Degradation Policies

| Degradation Level | Trigger | User Impact | Recovery Action |
| ----------------- | ------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| Level 1 (Minor) | Non-critical service unavailable | Limited feature availability | Automatic retry and recovery |
| Level 2 (Moderate) | Multiple non-critical services down | Reduced functionality | Alert on-call engineer |
| Level 3 (Severe) | Critical service degraded | Core functionality impacted | Incident response team activation |
| Level 4 (Critical) | Multiple critical services down | System unusable | DR plan activation |

The system implements graceful degradation by prioritizing core functionality:
- Rate submission and approval workflows are highest priority
- Analytics and reporting can be degraded during high load
- AI recommendations can fall back to simpler algorithms
- Real-time updates can degrade to polling

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Service Health Monitoring] --> B{Health Status}
    B -->|Healthy| C[Full Service]
    B -->|Degraded| D{Degradation Level}

| BillingHistory | billing_date | Range by month | 7 years |
| Messages | created_at | Range by month | 3 years |
| AuditLogs | timestamp | Range by month | 7 years |

This partitioning strategy allows for efficient queries on recent data while maintaining historical records for compliance and analytics.

#### Replication Configuration

The system uses a multi-tier replication strategy:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Primary Database] --> B[Synchronous Standby]
    A --> C[Asynchronous Replica 1]
    A --> D[Asynchronous Replica 2]
    
    B --> E[Disaster Recovery]
    C --> F[Analytics Queries]
    D --> G[Reporting Queries]
```

| Replica Type | Purpose | Sync Method | Failover Priority |
| ------------ | ------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| Synchronous Standby | High availability | Synchronous | Automatic |
| Asynchronous Replica 1 | Analytics workload | Asynchronous | Manual |
| Asynchronous Replica 2 | Reporting workload | Asynchronous | Manual |
| Disaster Recovery | Business continuity | Asynchronous | Manual |

#### Backup Architecture

The backup strategy includes multiple layers of protection:

| Backup Type | Frequency | Retention | Storage |
| ----------- | --------- | --------- | ------- |
| Full Backup | Daily | 30 days | S3 (encrypted) |
| Incremental Backup | Hourly | 7 days | S3 (encrypted) |
| Transaction Logs | Continuous | 7 days | S3 (encrypted) |
| Point-in-Time Recovery | N/A | 7 days | Database feature |
| Snapshot Backup | Weekly | 1 year | S3 Glacier |

Cross-region backups are maintained for disaster recovery purposes, with automated verification of backup integrity.

### DATA MANAGEMENT

#### Migration Procedures

The system supports several data migration paths:

| Migration Type | Source | Destination | Validation |
| -------------- | ------ | ----------- | ---------- |
| Initial Load | Client eBilling | Justice Bid | Field mapping verification |
| Historical Data | Law Firm Billing | Justice Bid | Completeness check |
| Rate Export | Justice Bid | Client eBilling | Rate matching verification |
| Attorney Data | UniCourt API | Justice Bid | Attorney mapping confirmation |

The migration process follows these steps:

1. Configuration of source/destination mappings
2. Sample data validation
3. Incremental migration with checkpoints
4. Post-migration validation
5. Rollback capability if validation fails

#### Versioning Strategy

The database employs a comprehensive versioning approach:

| Entity | Versioning Method | History Storage | Retrieval |
| ------ | ----------------- | --------------- | --------- |
| Rates | Temporal tables | Rate history JSONB | Point-in-time query |
| OCGs | Explicit versioning | Version number | Version comparison |
| Negotiations | State transitions | Audit log | Timeline reconstruction |
| Messages | Immutable records | No updates allowed | Thread view |

All rate changes are stored with complete history, including:
- Previous values
- Change timestamp
- User who made the change
- Associated message or justification

#### Archival Policies

The system implements tiered data archival:

| Data Type | Active Retention | Archive Retention | Archive Storage |
| --------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | -------------- |
| Rate Data | 2 years | 7+ years | S3 Glacier |
| Billing History | 2 years | 7+ years | S3 Glacier |
| Negotiations | 2 years | 7+ years | S3 Glacier |
| Messages | 2 years | 7+ years | S3 Glacier |
| Audit Logs | 1 year | 7+ years | S3 Glacier |

Archival processes include:
1. Data compression and encryption
2. Metadata indexing for searchability
3. Periodic archive verification
4. Compliance-driven retention enforcement

#### Data Storage and Retrieval Mechanisms

The system employs a polyglot persistence approach:

| Data Type | Storage Technology | Access Pattern | Optimization |
| --------- | ------------------ | -------------- | ------------ |
| Transactional Data | PostgreSQL | ACID transactions | Indexing, partitioning |
| Document Data | PostgreSQL JSONB | Flexible schema | GIN indexing |
| Full-text Search | PostgreSQL + tsvector | Text search | Full-text indexing |
| Analytics Data | PostgreSQL | Analytical queries | Materialized views |
| Cached Data | Redis | High-speed access | Time-based expiration |

Data retrieval mechanisms include:
- Parameterized queries with prepared statements
- Cursor-based pagination for large result sets
- Batch processing for analytics operations
- Materialized views for common analytics queries

#### Caching Policies

This comprehensive database design supports the complex requirements of the Justice Bid Rate Negotiation System, providing robust data management, performance optimization, and compliance capabilities while maintaining the flexibility needed for future expansion.

## 6.3 INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE

### API DESIGN

The Justice Bid Rate Negotiation System implements a comprehensive API architecture to facilitate integration with external systems, particularly eBilling platforms, law firm billing systems, and third-party data providers like UniCourt.

#### Protocol Specifications

| Protocol | Usage | Justification |
| -------- | ----- | ------------- |
| REST | Primary API protocol | Industry standard, wide compatibility with eBilling systems |
| GraphQL | Analytics queries | Efficient for complex data queries with multiple filters |
| WebSockets | Real-time updates | Enables collaborative negotiation features |

The system exposes RESTful APIs following these principles:
- Resource-based URL structure (e.g., `/api/v1/rates`, `/api/v1/negotiations`)
- Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for CRUD operations
- JSON as the primary data exchange format
- Consistent error response structure
- Hypermedia links for resource discovery

#### Authentication Methods

| Method | Use Case | Implementation |
| ------ | -------- | -------------- |
| OAuth 2.0 | User authentication | Authorization code flow for web applications |
| JWT | API authentication | Signed tokens with short expiration for API calls |
| API Keys | System integration | For eBilling and law firm system integration |
| SAML 2.0 | Enterprise SSO | For client and law firm SSO integration |

The system implements a multi-layered authentication approach:
- Interactive users authenticate via OAuth 2.0 or SAML
- System-to-system integration uses API keys with JWT
- All authentication methods support MFA where applicable

#### Authorization Framework

The authorization framework implements a role-based access control (RBAC) model with attribute-based refinements:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Authentication] --> B[Identity Verification]
    B --> C[Role Assignment]
    C --> D[Permission Calculation]
    D --> E[Resource Access]
    
    F[Organization Context] --> D
    G[Data Ownership] --> D
    H[Relationship Context] --> D
```

API authorization is enforced at multiple levels:
- Gateway level: Basic authentication and rate limiting
- Service level: Role and permission verification
- Data level: Row-level security based on organization relationships

#### Rate Limiting Strategy

| API Category | Rate Limit | Burst Allowance | Throttling Response |
| ------------ | ---------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| Standard APIs | 100 req/min | 150 req/min for 1 min | 429 Too Many Requests |
| Bulk Operations | 20 req/min | 30 req/min for 1 min | 429 with Retry-After |
| Analytics APIs | 30 req/min | 45 req/min for 1 min | 429 with Retry-After |
| Critical Operations | 50 req/min | 75 req/min for 1 min | 429 with Retry-After |

Rate limits are implemented using a token bucket algorithm with:
- Per-client rate limiting based on API key or user
- Graduated response to limit violations (warning, throttling, blocking)
- Clear documentation of limits in API responses via headers

#### Versioning Approach

The API versioning strategy follows these principles:

| Version Element | Approach | Example |
| --------------- | -------- | ------- |
| Major Version | URL path | `/api/v1/rates` |
| Minor Version | Accept header | `Accept: application/vnd.justicebid.v1.2+json` |
| Deprecation | HTTP headers | `Deprecation: true, Sunset: Sat, 31 Dec 2023 23:59:59 GMT` |

The versioning lifecycle includes:
- Minimum 12-month support for deprecated versions
- Clear documentation of breaking vs. non-breaking changes
- Version-specific documentation
- Migration guides between major versions

#### Documentation Standards

API documentation follows the OpenAPI 3.0 specification and includes:

- Interactive API documentation using Swagger UI
- Code samples in multiple languages
- Authentication and authorization examples
- Rate limiting information
- Versioning details
- Error code reference
- Integration patterns and best practices

## 6.4 SECURITY ARCHITECTURE

### AUTHENTICATION FRAMEWORK

The Justice Bid Rate Negotiation System implements a comprehensive authentication framework to ensure secure access while providing a seamless user experience for both law firms and clients.

#### Identity Management

| Component | Implementation | Purpose |
| --------- | -------------- | ------- |
| User Registry | Centralized identity store | Maintains user profiles, credentials, and organizational relationships |
| Identity Providers | SAML 2.0, OAuth 2.0 | Supports enterprise SSO integration for clients and law firms |
| Account Provisioning | API-driven, invitation-based | Controls user onboarding through organizational invitations |
| Identity Verification | Email verification, admin approval | Ensures authenticity of user accounts |

The system does not allow self-registration. Instead, users are invited by:
- Justice Bid administrators inviting client or law firm organizations
- Client or law firm administrators inviting members of their own organizations
- Clients inviting law firms to participate in rate negotiations

#### Multi-Factor Authentication

| MFA Method | Use Case | Implementation |
| ---------- | -------- | -------------- |
| Time-based OTP | Standard MFA option | TOTP with QR code setup |
| Email OTP | Fallback option | Time-limited codes sent via email |
| SSO with MFA | Enterprise users | Delegates MFA to identity provider |
| Recovery Process | Account recovery | Admin-assisted recovery with verification |

MFA is:
- Required for all administrative accounts
- Required for users with approval authority
- Optional but recommended for standard users
- Configurable at the organization level by administrators

#### Session Management

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Unauthenticated
    Unauthenticated --> Authenticating: Login attempt
    Authenticating --> Authenticated: Successful authentication
    Authenticating --> Unauthenticated: Failed authentication
    Authenticated --> MFARequired: If MFA enabled
    MFARequired --> SessionActive: Successful MFA
    MFARequired --> Unauthenticated: Failed MFA
    Authenticated --> SessionActive: If MFA not required
    SessionActive --> SessionIdle: Inactivity timeout
    SessionIdle --> SessionActive: User activity
    SessionIdle --> Unauthenticated: Session timeout
    SessionActive --> Unauthenticated: Logout
    Unauthenticated --> [*]
```

| Session Parameter | Value | Justification |
| ----------------- | ----- | ------------- |
| Session Timeout | 2 hours | Balance between security and user experience |
| Idle Timeout | 30 minutes | Prevents unauthorized access to unattended sessions |
| Concurrent Sessions | Limited to 3 | Prevents credential sharing while allowing legitimate multi-device usage |
| Session Binding | Device fingerprinting | Detects session hijacking attempts |

#### Token Handling

| Token Type | Purpose | Lifetime | Storage |
| ---------- | ------- | -------- | ------- |
| Access Token | API authorization | 1 hour | HTTP-only cookies with secure flag |
| Refresh Token | Session renewal | 24 hours | HTTP-only cookies with secure flag |
| ID Token | User identity | 1 hour | Memory (not persisted) |
| API Keys | System integration | Configurable | Secure credential store |

Token security measures include:
- JWT signing using RS256 algorithm
- Token rotation on privilege changes
- Automatic token revocation on password change
- Blacklisting of compromised tokens

#### Password Policies

| Policy | Requirement | Enforcement |
| ------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| Minimum Length | 12 characters | Registration and password change |
| Complexity | Requires 3 of 4: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols | Registration and password change |
| History | No reuse of last 10 passwords | Password change |
| Maximum Age | 90 days | Automatic expiration notification |
| Account Lockout | 5 failed attempts, 15-minute lockout | Login attempt monitoring |

### AUTHORIZATION SYSTEM

#### Role-Based Access Control

The system implements a hierarchical RBAC model with organization-specific roles:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[System Administrator] --> B[Organization Administrator]
    B --> C[Rate Administrator]
    B --> D[Approver]
    B --> E[Analyst]
    B --> F[Standard User]

## 6.5 MONITORING AND OBSERVABILITY

### MONITORING INFRASTRUCTURE

The Justice Bid Rate Negotiation System implements a comprehensive monitoring infrastructure to ensure system reliability, performance, and security. This infrastructure is designed to provide real-time visibility into all aspects of the system's operation.

#### Metrics Collection

| Component | Collection Method | Metrics Type | Retention |
| --------- | ----------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| Application Services | Prometheus agents | Performance, business metrics | 30 days (raw), 1 year (aggregated) |
| Infrastructure | CloudWatch | Resource utilization, health | 14 days (raw), 1 year (aggregated) |
| Databases | Database exporter | Query performance, connections | 14 days (raw), 1 year (aggregated) |
| APIs | API Gateway metrics | Latency, error rates, throughput | 30 days (raw), 1 year (aggregated) |

The metrics collection architecture employs a pull-based model for application metrics and a push-based model for infrastructure metrics:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Application Services] -->|Expose metrics| B[Prometheus]
    C[Infrastructure] -->|Push metrics| D[CloudWatch]
    E[Databases] -->|Expose metrics| B
    F[APIs] -->|Push metrics| D
    
    B -->|Scrape| G[Prometheus Server]
    D -->|Export| G
    
    G -->|Store| H[Time Series Database]
    H -->|Query| I[Grafana]
    
    J[Log Sources] -->|Forward logs| K[Fluent Bit]
    K -->|Ship| L[Elasticsearch]
    L -->|Index| M[Elasticsearch Cluster]
    M -->|Query| N[Kibana]
    
    O[Distributed Traces] -->|Collect| P[OpenTelemetry Collector]
    P -->|Export| Q[Jaeger]
    Q -->|Store| R[Jaeger Storage]
    R -->|Query| S[Jaeger UI]
    
    I --> T[Unified Dashboard]
    N --> T
    S --> T
```

#### Log Aggregation

The system implements a centralized logging architecture with structured logging:

| Log Source | Format | Collection Method | Retention |
| ---------- | ------ | ----------------- | --------- |
| Application Logs | JSON | Fluent Bit agents | 30 days (full), 1 year (errors) |
| API Gateway Logs | JSON | CloudWatch Logs | 30 days |
| Database Logs | Text | CloudWatch Logs | 14 days |
| Infrastructure Logs | JSON | CloudWatch Logs | 14 days |

All logs include standardized fields:
- Timestamp with timezone
- Correlation ID for request tracing
- Service name and instance ID
- Log level (INFO, WARN, ERROR, DEBUG)
- User ID (when applicable)
- Organization ID (when applicable)
- Request details (for API logs)

#### Distributed Tracing

The system implements end-to-end distributed tracing to track requests across service boundaries:

| Component | Implementation | Sampling Rate | Retention |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------- | --------- |
| Frontend | OpenTelemetry Browser | 10% of requests | 7 days |
| API Gateway | X-Ray | 100% of errors, 10% of normal | 7 days |
| Backend Services | OpenTelemetry | 100% of errors, 10% of normal | 7 days |
| Database Calls | Custom instrumentation | Threshold-based | 7 days |

Trace context is propagated through:
- HTTP headers for service-to-service communication
- Message headers for asynchronous processing
- Database comments for query tracing

#### Alert Management

The alert management system follows a tiered approach based on severity:

| Severity | Response Time | Notification Channels | Escalation |
| -------- | ------------- | -------------------- | ---------- |
| Critical | 15 minutes | PagerDuty, SMS, Email | Auto-escalation after 15 min |
| High | 1 hour | PagerDuty, Email | Auto-escalation after 1 hour |
| Medium | 4 hours | Email, Slack | Manual escalation |
| Low | 24 hours | Email, Dashboard | No escalation |

Alert routing is based on:
- Service ownership
- Time of day and on-call schedules
- Alert type and component
- Previous resolution patterns

#### Dashboard Design

The monitoring system includes several purpose-built dashboards:

| Dashboard | Audience | Content | Refresh Rate |
| --------- | -------- | ------- | ------------ |
| Executive | Management | SLA compliance, business metrics | 15 minutes |
| Operations | SRE team | System health, resource utilization | 1 minute |
| Service | Development teams | Service-specific metrics, errors | 30 seconds |
| Security | Security team | Authentication, authorization events | 5 minutes |

| | selecting option 5.2 for Staffing (2 points) | |

| | This would better align with your workflow   | |

$color-success: #38A169;
$color-warning: #DD6B20;
$color-error: #E53E3E;
$color-info: #3182CE;

// Typography
$font-family-base: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
$font-family-mono: 'Roboto Mono', monospace;
$font-size-base: 16px;
$font-weight-normal: 400;

// Borders
$border-radius-sm: 2px;
$border-radius-md: 4px;
$border-radius-lg: 8px;
$border-width: 1px;
$border-color: rgba($color-neutral, 0.2);

// Shadows
$shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);
$shadow-md: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
$shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);

// Transitions
$transition-fast: 150ms ease-in-out;
$transition-normal: 250ms ease-in-out;
$transition-slow: 350ms ease-in-out;
```

#### Component Implementation

The design system will be implemented using React components with styled-components for styling:

```jsx
// Button component example
import styled from 'styled-components';

const Button = styled.button`
  background-color: ${props => 
    props.variant === 'primary' ? props.theme.colors.primary : 
    props.variant === 'secondary' ? props.theme.colors.secondary :
    'transparent'
  };
  color: ${props => 
    props.variant === 'primary' || props.variant === 'secondary' ? 
    'white' : props.theme.colors.primary
  };
  padding: ${props => props.theme.spacing.sm} ${props => props.theme.spacing.md};
  border-radius: ${props => props.theme.borderRadius.md};
  border: ${props => 
    props.variant === 'outline' ? 
    `${props.theme.borderWidth} solid ${props.theme.colors.primary}` : 
    'none'
  };
  font-weight: ${props => props.theme.fontWeights.medium};
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: all ${props => props.theme.transitions.normal};
  
  &:hover {
    background-color: ${props => 
      props.variant === 'primary' ? props.theme.colors.primaryDark : 
      props.variant === 'secondary' ? props.theme.colors.secondaryDark :
      props.theme.colors.backgroundLight
    };
  }
  
  &:focus {
    outline: none;
    box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px ${props => props.theme.colors.primaryLight};
  }
  
  &:disabled {
    opacity: 0.6;
    cursor: not-allowed;
  }
`;

export default Button;
```

### 7.10 ANIMATION AND TRANSITIONS

The Justice Bid Rate Negotiation System will use subtle animations and transitions to enhance the user experience:

| Element | Animation | Purpose |
| ------- | --------- | ------- |
| Page Transitions | Fade in/out | Smooth navigation between pages |
| Modal Dialogs | Scale and fade | Focus attention on modal content |
| Notifications | Slide in from top | Non-intrusive notification display |
| Data Updates | Highlight and fade | Indicate changed values |
| Expandable Sections | Smooth height transition | Natural expansion/collapse |
| Loading States | Pulsing skeleton | Indicate content loading |
| Chart Animations | Progressive reveal | Enhance data comprehension |
| Button States | Subtle scale | Provide feedback on interaction |

All animations will be designed to be subtle and purposeful, enhancing the user experience without causing distraction or accessibility issues. Animation durations will be kept short (150-350ms) to maintain a responsive feel.

## 8. INFRASTRUCTURE

### DEPLOYMENT ENVIRONMENT

#### Target Environment Assessment

The Justice Bid Rate Negotiation System requires a robust, secure, and scalable cloud infrastructure to support its complex workflows, data processing needs, and integration requirements.

| Aspect | Requirement | Justification |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| Environment Type | Cloud (AWS primary) | Scalability needs, global accessibility, and enterprise-grade security requirements |
| Geographic Distribution | Multi-region deployment | Support for global client base, data residency compliance, disaster recovery |
| Resource Requirements | High-performance compute, scalable storage | Complex analytics processing, large historical datasets, AI workloads |
| Compliance Requirements | SOC 2, GDPR, CCPA | Financial data handling, PII storage, multi-national client base |

The system's workload characteristics require an infrastructure that can scale dynamically to handle:
- Periodic spikes during annual rate negotiation seasons
- Concurrent negotiations across multiple client-firm relationships
- Computationally intensive analytics and AI processing
- Large data imports/exports with eBilling systems

#### Environment Management
