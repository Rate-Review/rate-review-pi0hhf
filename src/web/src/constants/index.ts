 * This file serves as a central export point for all application constants,
 * allowing components to import constants from a single location rather than
 * from individual constant files.
 * 
 * Example usage:
 * import { NEGOTIATION_STATUS, RATE_ACTION, API_URL } from 'constants';
 *
 * @version 1.0.0
